# Breast-Cancer-Analysis

This analysis is conducted by myself just for practice. The data is from Kaggle.
I first created visualization and then applied logistic, decision tree, random forest, and SVM models for prediction and compared models' performance. The notebook can also be found by the kaggle link(https://www.kaggle.com/nancysunxx/breast-cancer-prediction).
